# electric-field-generator
[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

This is a python program that draws electric field lines given charges on a graph.
It uses the ==matplotlib.pyplot== library, specifically ==streamplot== to draw electric field lines between a user specified number of charges.
The graph generated by the script currently is not reflective of the magnitude of the charges specified by the user, treating the charges as equal magnitude.

## Usage

```
python3 graphfield.py
Please enter charge particle values in the following format separated by spaces: x_position, y_position, charge_value
1 0 1
x position: 1
y position: 0
charge: 1
```
